# Project Overview
## Map Reduce Design Considerations
* How do we assign work units to workers?
* What if we have more work units than workers?
* What if workers need to share partial results? 
* How do we aggregate partial results? ï‚§ How do we know all the workers have finished?
*  What if workers fail?

# Mini Google Overview
__1.__ Hadoop Implementation 
* HDFS
* MapReduce Engine
* HBase / Lucene ( will not be used in project but influences designs)

__2.__ Alternate Implementation 
* Distributed File System - Data Storage and Batch Processing
* MapReduce - Computing 
* Inverted Index - Searching and Query Handling

# Hadoop  
## Hadoop Phases 
1. Map
2. Sort/ Shuffle / Aggregate
3. Reduce 
   

## Hadoop Cluster
![yarn](https://2xbbhjxc6wk3v21p62t8n4d4-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/yarnflow1.png)
* Master Nodes
    * Yarn Resource Manager
    * HDFS Name Node
    * Job Trackers 
    * Work Queue
* Worker Nodes
    * Yarn NodeManager 
    * HDFS DataNode
    * Task Tracker and tasks

# Hadoop Communication Paradigmns

## Job Tracker - Task Tracker 
* ___Task Trackers__ 
    * create and remove tasks received from the job trackers 
    * communicates task status to job tracker by sending heartbeats
* ___Job Tracker__
    * Manages task trackers 
    * Schedule and tracks jobs progress
    * Receives jobs from clients

## Map to Combine


## Combine to Partition

## Partion to Reducer

# HDFS Design Considerations

## HDFS Operations
* Read - Load data 

## Components
* Name Node 
* Data Node
* Task Tracker
